# Environment variables for the application

# This is the connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
# For local development using Docker Compose, it typically points to the 'db' service.
# For production, this should be updated to your production database URI.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres

# You can add other environment-specific variables here.
# For example, the frontend can use this to determine the API endpoint.
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
